# BurgerBuster
## What is this?
This Node application that provides the user with a lits of burgers (eaten and uneaten) and a form which allows the user to add their own burger. Any uneaten burger also comes with a button that devours the burger, moving it from the uneaten column to the eaten column.

## How to get started
To use this app, the user can first add a new burger by entering its name into the form at the bottom of the page. After the user can decide to consume the burger by clicking on its respective "Devour" button. Finally the user can look over the list of all existing uneaten and eaten burgers shown in the center of the page.
